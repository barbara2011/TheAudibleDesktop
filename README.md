Log of changes to The Audible Desktop

version 0.028

-- Calculation of the actual size of the area being recorded is now displayed. (This is a convenience to a user who may want to set a custom recording size in the Syphon Recorder app, rather than relying on a preset frame-size.)
-- Minor adjustments to visual design of the GUI.


version 0.027

--Minor changes to text.
--Embedded two more files within package's extensions subfolder (in addition to jit.gl.syphonserver.mxo previously added): jit.gl.syphonclient.mxo, spigot~.mxo. These two additional extensions are in anticipation of future use.
